# Data Preprocessing Pipeline for Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a basic data preprocessing pipeline using Python, aimed at preparing data for machine learning models. It covers essential preprocessing tasks such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, splitting the data, and scaling features.

## Summary

The project uses a dataset named `Data.csv`, which includes information about individuals, such as their country, age, salary, and whether they made a purchase. The goal is to preprocess this data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### Key Steps in the Pipeline:
1. **Handling Missing Data**: Replaces missing values in numerical columns with the mean.
2. **Encoding Categorical Data**: Converts categorical features into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
3. **Train-Test Split**: Splits the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.
4. **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
